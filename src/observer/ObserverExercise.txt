Create a simple event management system that allows users to create and manage events. The system should have an "Event" class that holds information about an event and a "Calendar"
 class that holds a list of events. The Calendar class should be an observer of the Event class. When an event is created or modified, the Calendar class should notify all of its
 observers to update their calendars.
